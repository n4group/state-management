# State

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

- an elegant, yet profoundly simple way to manage application state
- it is a design pattern
- completely framework agnostic and coincidentally works really well with Angular
- [Tutorial](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux)
- the entire state of the application is represented in a single JavaScript object called a store
- that can be acted upon using special functions called reducers
- important is that state is immutable and reducers are the only part of the application that can change them
- the consolidation and immutability of state makes understanding and predicting how an application will behave exponentially easier
