- [angular redux gist](https://gist.github.com/btroncone/a6e4347326749f938510#introduction) - comprehensive state of the art
- an elegant, yet profoundly simple way to manage application state
- it is a design pattern
- completely framework agnostic and coincidentally works really well with Angular
- [Tutorial](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux)
- the entire state of the application is represented in a single JavaScript object called a store
- that can be acted upon using special functions called reducers
- important is that state is immutable and reducers are the only part of the application that can change them
- the consolidation and immutability of state makes understanding and predicting how an application will behave exponentially easier
